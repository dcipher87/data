# Introduction

Data manipulation in spreadsheets will cover the following:
- Working with cell formulas:
	1. Text data
	2. Math operations
	3. Statistical functions
- Performing data operations at the table level:
	1. Duplicating rows
	2. Splitting columns
	3. Sorting data

# Cell Formulas

Cell Formula
An expression, beginning with an equal sign (=), that defines the operations which calculate the value for the cell. These may be a constant, contain mathematical operators or functions, or may reference a single cell, a range of cells, or no cells.

Function
A standard-defined built-in routine that calculates a value from inputs provided. They always begin with a key word (e.g. =sum, =average)

Parameter
Value of expressions required by a function to determine a result, defined by the function. These can be a constant, cell reference, range reference, other expression or another function.

Different functions can be found in the Formulas library.

## Substitute
Text functions modify or provide information about text strings found in data.

Text String: String of letters, numbers and punctuation that is not treated numerically. (e.g. Names, phrases, citites, not a date or number)

While the SUBSTITUTION function sounds similar to find/replace, it is used for different purposes. Find/replace gets rid of the old data, while SUBSTITUTION will not change the original cell, instead showing the transformed data in a new cell.

SUBSTITUTION uses the syntax:
SUBSTITUTE ({text}, {old_text}, {new_text}), 
where {text} is the cell to change, {old_text} is the string sequence to be replaced, and {new_text} is the new string in place of the old one.

## Extract Text
FIND and LEFT can be used to extract text. 
FIND can be given a substring and a cell to return the position in astring whrer the substring was found.
LEFT can then be used to extract a certain number of characters from a cell, starting from the left side.
RIGHT therefor extracts from the right side, while MID can extract from some starting point in the middle of a cell.

--- NB: More exercises are needed for the extract text exercises, particulary Nested Formulas! ---

## Reformat Text

### Concatenate
This functin will join together two or more strings. This will not automatically add spaces between them, so spaces must be added manually as formula parameters if they are required.

### Trim
This function removes excess whitespace fro a string.

### Proper
This function sets the first letter of each word to upper case, with the rest lowercase(like title: e.g. Khaya Ubisi)

### Upper and Lower
Upper sets all letters of the string to upper case (KHAYA UBISI), while lower sets all letters to lowercase (khaya ubisi).


# Math Functions

Math operations are one of the most common spreadsheet usages. These are used similarly to what we'd expect (with a leading equals sign):
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division

Spreadsheets also allow for functions to be used to perfom maths, like the SUM and AVERAGE functions which will provide the Sum or Average of two or more cells, numbers or range of cells.

### Duplicate Rows 
Use duplicate function.

### Split Columns

Splitting data is useful when you have data such as first and last names, or city and state, separated by a delimiter (e.g. a comma or a space). In Excel (and Google sheets) this can be done by adding a column to the right of theone you want to split, and then in the DATA tab, selecting "Text to Columns".

Make sure you add the extra column first, as existing data may be overwritten in the next column.

View >> Freeze functionality is useful to always display column headings (for example) when scrolling through large data sets.

### Sort Data
The sort function is available under the data tab. The data you want to sort needs to be selected. You can sort based on one or more columns (e.g. sort by first names, then if duplicate first names exist, sort by last name).

### Filter Data

a method to group data by selecting characteristics of one or more columns of a data set. Filter is accessed under the data tab.
