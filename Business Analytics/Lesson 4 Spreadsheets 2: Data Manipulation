# Introduction

Data manipulation in spreadsheets will cover the following:
- Working with cell formulas:
	1. Text data
	2. Math operations
	3. Statistical functions
- Performing data operations at the table level:
	1. Duplicating rows
	2. Splitting columns
	3. Sorting data

# Cell Formulas

Cell Formula
An expression, beginning with an equal sign (=), that defines the operations which calculate the value for the cell. These may be a constant, contain mathematical operators or functions, or may reference a single cell, a range of cells, or no cells.

Function
A standard-defined built-in routine that calculates a value from inputs provided. They always begin with a key word (e.g. =sum, =average)

Parameter
Value of expressions required by a function to determine a result, defined by the function. These can be a constant, cell reference, range reference, other expression or another function.

Different functions can be found in the Formulas library.

## Substitute
Text functions modify or provide information about text strings found in data.

Text String: String of letters, numbers and punctuation that is not treated numerically. (e.g. Names, phrases, citites, not a date or number)

While the SUBSTITUTION function sounds similar to find/replace, it is used for different purposes. Find/replace gets rid of the old data, while SUBSTITUTION will not change the original cell, instead showing the transformed data in a new cell.

SUBSTITUTION uses the syntax:
SUBSTITUTE ({text}, {old_text}, {new_text}), 
where {text} is the cell to change, {old_text} is the string sequence to be replaced, and {new_text} is the new string in place of the old one.

## Extract Text
FIND and LEFT can be used to extract text. 
FIND can be given a substring and a cell to return the position in astring whrer the substring was found.
LEFT can then be used to extract a certain number of characters from a cell, starting from the left side.
RIGHT therefor extracts from the right side, while MID can extract from some starting point in the middle of a cell.
