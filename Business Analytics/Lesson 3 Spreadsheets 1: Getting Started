# Why Spreadsheets

Spreadsheets started off as a manual way of tracking things like sales and keeping running totals of columns and performing maths on these column.

Spreadsheets are easy to obtain and use, they are quick at loading, modifying and visualising data. They do have limitations such as issues when there are a lot of users, very large datasets as well as variance in sheet sizes and amounts when porting to different programs.

## Navigation

Spreadsheet columns use letters as their labels, A - Z, continuing on by adding an initial letter to again run through the alphabe (so AA - AZ, then BA - BZ).
Rows are numbered numerically. Each cell is addressed based on its column and row, so the cell in Column D and row 6 is D6.

When working with multiple sheets, the tab name also becomes part of the cell name, if addressed from a different sheet.
