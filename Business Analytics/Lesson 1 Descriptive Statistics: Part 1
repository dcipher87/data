I. Data and its importance

# Data is defined as distinct pieces of information and it can come in many forms. From numbers in a spreadsheet, to text, video and databases, to images and audio recordings. Data is used to understand and improve nearly every facet of our lives.

# Data Types

Data can fall into two main types (for purposes of this course):
- Quantitative: data that takes on numeric values that allow us to perform mathematical operations (like the number of dogs)
- Categorical: data that is used to label a group or set of items (like dog breeds - danes, collies, poodles etc.)

## Categorical Ordinal vs Categorical Nominal
We can divide catergorical data further into two types: Ordinal and Nominal:

- Categorical Ordinal data take on a ranked ordering (like ranked interaction on a scale from 'Very Poor' to 'Very Good' with dogs.)
- Categorical Nominal data do ot have an order or ranking (like the breeds of dogs.)

## Continuous vs Discrete (Quantitative Data)
We can think of quantitative data as being either continuous or descrete:

- Continuous data can be split into smaller and smaller units, and still smaller units exist. An example of this is the age of the dog. We can measure the units of age in years, months, days, hours, seconds but there are still smaller units that could be associated with the age. (can take on decimal values e.g. time, distance)
- Discret data only takes on countable values. The number of dogs we interact with is an example of a  discrete data type. (mostly only whole numbers)

II. Introduction to Summary Statistics

Statistics can be used to describe quantitative data. It involves how data is collected and how data can be used to answer questions.

# Analysing Quantitative Data

Four aspects for quantitative data
There are four main aspects to analysing quantiative data:
1. Measures of Center
2. Measures of Spread
3. The Shape of the Data
4. Outliers

# Analysing Categorical Data

Analysing categorical data has fewer parts to consider. Catergorical data is analysed usually by looking at the counts or proprtion of individuals that fall into each group. For example, if we werer looking at the breeds of the dogs, we would care about how many dogs are of each breed, or what proportion of dogs are of each breed.

# Measures of Center

There are three measures of center:
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode

## The Mean

The mean is oftern called the average or the expected value in mathematics. We calculate the mean by adding all of our values together and dividing by the number of values in our dataset. 
(e.g. test results: 68, 74, 91. Mean = (68 + 74 + 91) / 3)

## The Median

The median splits our data so that 50% of our values are lower and 50% are higher. The median is calculated based on whether the number of observation is odd or even.

### Median for Odd Values
If we have an odd number of observations, the median is simple the number in the direct middle (when the observations are ordered, e.g. smallest to largest). If we have 7 observations the median is the 4th value, if 9 oservations the median will be the 5th value.

### Median for Even Values
If we have an even number of observations, the median is the average (mean) of the two values in the middle of the dataset. If we have 8 observations, we average the 4th and 5th values together when our values are ordered (e.g. smallest to largest).

In order to compute the median, we MUST sort our values first.

Whether we use the mean or median to describe a dataset is largely dependent on the shape of our dataset and if there are any outliers.


## The Mode

The mode is the most frequently observed value in our dataset (the most common value). There might be multiple modes for a particular dataset or no mode at all.

### No Mode
If all observations in our dataset are observed with the same frequency, there is no mode. If we have the dataset:
1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4
There is no mode because all observations occur the same number of times.

### Many Modes
If 2 (or more) values share the maximum frequency, then there is more than 1 mode. If we have the dataset:
1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9
There are 2 modes 3 and 6, because these values share the maximum frequency at 3 times each while all other values appear once.

# Notation

Notation is a common language used to communicate mathematical ideas. It is the universal language used by academics and industry professionals to covery mathematical ideas. 

Plus(+), minus(-), multiply(*), division(/) and equals(=) all have mathematical symbols we're familiar with. Each symbol replaces an idea of how numbers interact with each other. Notation has the following properties:

1. Knowing how to read and write notation is like learning a new language. A language that is used to covery ideas associated with mathematics.

2. Notation allows you to read documentation, and implement an idea to your own problem.

3. Notation makes ideas that are hard to say in words easier to convey, usually mathematics related ideas.

Before collecting data, we usually start with a question, or multiple questions, that we would like to answer. The purpose of data is to help us in answering these questions.

## Random Variables

A random variable is a placeholder for the possible values of some process. Notation is useful in that it helps us take complex ideas and simplify them (often to a single letter or symbol). We see random variables represented by capital letters (X, Y, Z are common ways to represent a random variable).

We might have the random variable X, which is a holder for the possible values of the amount of time someone spends on our site. Or the random variable Y, which is a holder fot the possible values of whether or not an individual purchases a product.

X is 'a holder' of the values that could possibly occur for the amount of time spent on our website. Any number from 0 to infinity. 

### Capital vs. Lower Case Letters

Random variables are represented by capital letters. Once we observe an outcome of these random variables, we notate it as a lower case of the same letter.

Example 1
The amount of time someone spends on our iste is a random variable (we are not sure what the outocme for any particular visitor),and we notate this with X. Then when the first person visits the website, if they spend 5 minutes, we have now observed this outcome of our random variable. We would notate any outcome as a lowercase letter with a subscript associated with the order that we observed the outcome(e.g. x1 for the first observation).

If 5 inidividuals visit our website, the first spends 10 minutes, the second spends 20 minutes, the third spends 45 minutes, the fourth 12 minutes and the fifth 8 minutes, we can notate this problem the following way:

X is the amount of time an individual spends on the website.

x1 = 10, x2 = 20, x3 = 45, x4 = 12, x5 = 8.

The capital X is associated with this idea of a random variable, while the observations of the random variable take on lowercase x values.

Example 2
We could ask: What is the probability someone spends more than 20 minutes on our website?

In notation, we could write:

P(X > 20)?

Here P stands for probability, while the parentheses encompass the statement for which we would like to find the probability. Since X represents the amount of time spent on the website this notation represents the probability the amount of time on the website is greater than 20.

We could find this in the above example by noticing that only one of the 5 observations exceeds 20. So, we would say there is a 1 (the 45 minutes) in 5 or 20% chance that an inidividual spends more than 20 minutes on our website (based on this dataset).

Example 3
If we asked: What is the probability of an inidividual spending 20 or more minutes on our website? We could notate this as:

P(X >= 20)?

We could then find this by noticing there are two out of the five individuals that spend 20 or more minutes on the website. So this probabiliyt is 2 out of 5 or 40%.

### A better way?
Notation for calculating the Mean
The mean is calculated as the sum of all our values divided by the number of values in our dataset. In our current notation, adding all the values together can be tedious for large datasets. To add 3 values of a random variable we would use:

x1 + x2 + x3

To add 6 values, we would use the followng notation:

x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6

To extend this to add 100, 1000 or a million values would be ridiculous.

## Summation

### Aggregations
An aggregation is a way to turn multiple numbers into fewer numbers (commonly one number, e.g. like mean, median or mode).
Summation is a common aggregation. The notation used to sum our values is the greek symbol called sigma ∑.

Example 1
Imagine we are looking at the amount of time inidividuals spend on our website. We collect data from nine individuals:

x1 = 10, x2 = 20, x3 = 45, x4 = 12, x5 = 8, x6 = 12, x7 = 3, x8 = 68, x9 = 5

if we want to sum the first three values together in our previous notation, we write:

x1 + x2 + x3

In our new notation, we can write:

  3
 ∑xi
 i=1

Our notation starts at the first observation (i = 1) and ends at 3 (the number at the top of our summation).

  3
 ∑xi  =  x1 + x2 + x3  =  10 + 20 + 45  =  75
 i=1

Example 2
To sum the last three values together:

x7 + x8 + x9

In our new notation, we can write:

  9
 ∑xi
 i=7

 Out notation starts at the seventh observation (i=7) and ends at 9 (the number at the top of our summation).

 ### Other aggregations
 The ∑ sign is used for aggregating using summation, but we might choose to aggregate in other ways. Summing is one of the most common ways to need to aggregate. We might need to aggregate in alternative ways. If we wanted to multiply all of our values together we woul use a product sign Π, capital greek letter pi. The way we aggregate continuous values i with something know as integration (a common technique in calculus), which uses the following symbol ∫ which is just a long s.

 ### Notation for the Mean

 x̄ (x-bar) is the notation we use to represent the mean of a dataset. A general formula for the mean using notation uses n as the total number of values in our dataset. Therefore the mean notation is as follows:

 1   n
 -  ∑xi  The sum of all the values/number of values
 n  i=1

x-bar can also be y-bar or z-bar and any letter can be used as an index, not just i e.g.

1   n
-  ∑yj
n  j=1
